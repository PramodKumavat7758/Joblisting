# JobListing

JobListing is a Spring-based web application that allows users to list and search for job openings. It features the ability to list job postings, search for jobs by text, and add new job postings.

## Introduction

JobListing is a Spring Boot application designed to simplify job searching and posting. It provides a RESTful API for listing, searching, and adding job postings.

## Prerequisites

Before you start using JobListing, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Java 8 or higher
- Maven
- MongoDB (or another supported database)
- Spring Boot 2.5.x
- Any additional dependencies specified in your project's `pom.xml`.
